# Home Work - Java | Digital Skola Project 3

## Project Brief
The project was made to gain my Java Knowledge. So, Digital Skola gave me a task to develop application with following instructions:
 
 - Make a class with name StudyCase
 - The class is multiplying given arguments and defines whether it is even (Genap) or odd (Ganjil).

 ## Succes Criteria
 Run the command and give the correct output:
 ```
    $ java StudyCase 2 3 5
    >>> 30 - Genap
    $ java StudyCase 3 5
    >>> 15 - Ganjil
 ```
